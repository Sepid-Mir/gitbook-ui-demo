# Components Demo

This page demonstrates how MDX can import and render React components from your codebase.

## 🔘 Button Component

Here is the live `Button` component rendered inside MDX:

<Button label="Hello from GitBook!" />

You can change the `label` prop in the code to see how it updates in GitBook.

## 🃏 Card Component

And here is the `Card` component:

<Card 
  title="Sample Card" 
  description="This card is rendered from the Card.jsx component."
/>
